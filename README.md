# PDF Reducer

Tool to reduce the size of PDF files using Ghostscript with parallel processing.

## Summary
This tool splits a PDF file into chunks, reduces the size of each chunk using Ghostscript, and then combines the reduced chunks into a single optimized PDF file.

## Main Features
- **Parallel Processing: ** Splits and reduces PDF chunks simultaneously to speed up the process.
- **Image Optimization: ** Reduces image resolution to minimize file size.
- **Support for Large Files: ** Designed to handle large PDF files.
- **Auto-Cleanup: ** Automatically deletes temporary files generated during the process.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or later
- Ghostscript installed on the system
- PyPDF2 (installed automatically with `pip`)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/clasanch/pdf-reducer.git
cd pdf-reducer
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
The tool is run from the command line:

```bash
python main.py input.pdf -o output.pdf --chunk-size 10 --processes 4
```

### Parameters
```bash
input.pdf: Input PDF file (required)
-o/--output: Name of the output PDF file (default: reduced_final_file.pdf)
--chunk-size: Number of pages per chunk (default: 10)
--processes: Number of parallel processes (default: 4)
```

### Example Usage
```bash
python src/pdf_reducer.py large_document.pdf -o optimized_document.pdf --chunk-size 5 --processes 2
```

### Expected Results
An optimized PDF file with significantly reduced size.
Temporary chunk files are automatically deleted at the end of the process.

## Limitations
Requires Ghostscript to be installed and accessible on the system.
Not compatible with password-protected or DRM-protected PDFs.
Reducing the size may affect the quality of images.
